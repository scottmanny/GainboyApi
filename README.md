# HelloWorld

Sample project showcasing some basic use cases for akka-http, as well as docker packaging via [sbt-native-packager](https://github.com/sbt/sbt-native-packager)

### Dockerize app

clone the project and run: `$ sbt docker:publishLocal`

### Run container

After generating the container (step above), run the container:

`$ docker run -dit -p 5000:5000 --name gainboy-api gainboy-api:0.1`

You will get a response like this:

```
$ docker run -dit -p 5000:5000 --name gainboy-api gainboy-api:0.1
